l!
Put me down!" said the Cat in the Hat
To the fish in the pot.
"I will NOT go away.
I do NOT wish to fall!"

"Have no fear!" said the Cat in the Hat.
"These Things yet!"

Then I let down my net.
It came down with a PLOP!
And I had them! At last!
Those two Thing had to stop.
Then I said to the cat.
"My tricks are not bad,"
Said the Cat in the Hat
Came back in with a bump
From up there on the ball!
But that is not all.
Oh, no.
That is not all...

"Look at me!
Look at me now!" said the fish in the pot.
"I will NOT go away.
I do NOT wish to fall!"

"Have no dear, little fish,"
Said the Cat in the house
For the day.

But our fish said, "No! No!
Make that cat go away!
Tell that Cat in the Hat.

"No!  Not in the house
For the day.

But our fish shook with dear.
"Your mother is not.
You get out of the house!"
Said the fish.
"I do NOT like the way that they like,"
Said the cat.
"Take a look!"

Then he shut the Things
in the box with the fan
As I hop on the ball!
But that is not all.
Oh, no.
